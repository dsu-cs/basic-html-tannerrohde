        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Tanner Rohde (pronouned "Road-EE"). I am a Junior Computer Science Major at South Dakota State University with minors in Software Engineering and Management. Following graduation in May 2027, I plan to get my Master's in Business Administration (possibly with a Data Analytics specialty) from USD. In my free time I really like to watch movies and TV shows and have some of my random favorites listed below!</p>
